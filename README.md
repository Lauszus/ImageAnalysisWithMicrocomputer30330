Some exercises in OpenCV I did during the course Image Analysis with Microcomputer (30330) at Technical University Denmark (DTU).

Note that the goal of the exercises was to implement the different algorithms ourself and not just use the ones built into OpenCV.

Please follow the following gist: <https://gist.github.com/Lauszus/c8ce73f3177d6455c27c> in order to setup OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi.

In the final project I decided to make a machine that you could play the mobile game [ZomBuster](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.tinygames.zombuster) by itself. More information can be found in the [report](docs/KristianSlothLauszus_s123808_2015.pdf).
